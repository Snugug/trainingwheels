Setup Vagrant Dev Environment
-----------------------------

1. Download and install Vagrant and VirtualBox as per the Vagrant "Getting started" page.

2. Install the Ansible Vagrant plugin:

    `vagrant gem install vagrant-ansible`

Why are we not using the vagrant ansible plugin?  The problem is the setup of Ansible on the host Mac OSX machine. :<
