If you're a developer interested in working with us, please get in touch.\r\n\r\n### Is Training Wheels for me?\r\n\r\nDoes your training course require each student to have access to their own sandbox for hands-on application of the skills you're teaching? If it does, you could benefit from using Training Wheels.\r\n\r\nFor example, you may be teaching 20 students how to theme Drupal. You'd like each of them to have their own installation of Drupal available to work on, perhaps configured in a specific way with a few contributed modules installed. You probably also want a base theme setup for them to start working on.\r\n\r\nA traditional approach to solving this problem is to require each student to bring their laptop with a LAMP stack pre-installed. You _could_ distribute the base files and database to each student before the class, and require everyone arrive on the day with a working base site.\r\n\r\nThis option is problematic for many reasons:\r\n\r\n* What if your target audience (designers in this example) don't have the skills or time to precisely configure their local environments?\r\n* What if you need to change some settings in the base configuration at the last minute, requiring everyone to re-install?\r\n* What if a student falls behind or gets stuck in a certain place, can you bring their environment up to speed quickly so that they can continue with the course?\r\n* What if someone walks in on the day of training, can you quickly get them on board or would you have to turn them away?\r\n\r\n### The Training Wheels approach\r\n\r\nTraining Wheels solves this issue by configuring a single Linux server to be a multi-user developer environment, and then providing a controller site which allows an administrator command-line and web access to manage the student's environments.\r\n\r\nYou create a new cloud or physical server with your own domain name, for example `mytraining.com`. SSH into the machine and run the server configuration playbook. Run the controller setup playbook to install the controller. Everything is configured automatically and all configuration is open-source, meaning even the most pedantic sysadmins should be happy, as you can inspect and tweak every setting and configuration file in the extremely readable playbooks, before they are run on your server.\r\n\r\n### Flexibility\r\n\r\nThere are two components to Training Wheels: the controller site and the server setup playbooks.\r\n\r\nThe controller is an application built on [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com), [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org), some [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) components and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/). It is designed to be extremely flexible in what _kind_ of training course is being run. Do you need to provide each student an installation of Wordpress? Or a custom application? Or perhaps you only need a single Drupal site and each student should have a user account on that single site. The Training Wheels controller is designed from the ground up to handle these cases, although we are mostly developing for a LAMP stack.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to run the controller on the same server as the student environments if you don't want to - it supports administering the local server as well as a remote server over SSH.\r\n\r\nThe second component to an installation is the server configuration playbook, which is highly specific. We currently have a playbook to configure a server for a multi-user LAMP stack with SSH & FTP access for students, however we will surely accumulate many more playbooks in the future for setting up multi-user servers for other applications.\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\n\r\nThe server configuration playbooks use the [Ansible] (http://ansible.github.com/) configuration management tool.","name":"Training Wheels"}
